Takeaways

Duration: How long an iteration of an animation takes to complete
Iteration Count: How many times an animation should repeat
Delay: How long it takes before an animation starts (Delay is going to apply to the first iteration of the animation)
Timing Function: The easing of an animation. (A atenuação de uma animação)
cubic-bezier: A custom timing function that allows you to create your own easing curve
  Recebe 4 parametros: x1, y1, x2, y2 podemos pensar em coordana x e y como um plano cartesiano
  cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.5, 1) 
     0.5, 0 means the animation will start .5 at axis x and 0 axis y 
      0.5, 1 means the animation will end  .5 at axis x and 1 axis y
